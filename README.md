# Primus for PC

This is a JavaFX application that calculated pi ratios, phi ratios and prime numbers. It can do macro number calculations, being able to find millions of ratios or prime numbers at a time.
You can download it **in the "Builds for Downloads"** folder. There's also an Android version available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andersonaddo/Primus) and on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lumberjackapps.primus&hl=en).
